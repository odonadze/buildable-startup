# Buildable — Startup Operations

Internal repo for strategy, customer research, pitch materials, and competitive intel.

**Product repo:** [buildable-to/Buildable](https://github.com/buildable-to/Buildable)
**Project board:** [Buildable Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/buildable-to/projects/1)

## What is Buildable?

AI-powered structural engineering tool that generates construction-ready 2D drawings from natural language. Describe a foundation element — dimensions, rebar, concrete class — and get complete drawings with plan views, sections, rebar details, and bar bending schedules.

Built on FreeCAD (open-source parametric CAD) with a proprietary AI layer.

**Target vertical:** Precast concrete structural engineering
